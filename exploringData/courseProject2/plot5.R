# The NEI OnRoad and NonRoad data categories contain mobile sources which are estimated
# for the 2008 NEI v3 via the MOVES2010b and NONROAD models, respectively.
# NONROAD was run within the National Mobile Inventory Model (NMIM). Note that
# emissions data for aircraft, locomotives, and commercial marine vessels are
# NOT included in the NonRoad data category
