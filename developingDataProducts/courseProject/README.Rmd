To run Shinny locally. You should see a new webspage in your browser. By default the URL will be http://127.0.0.1:3228

```{r}
library(shiny)
runApp()
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
