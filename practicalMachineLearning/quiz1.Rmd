##Question 1
Load the Alzheimer's disease data using the commands:

```{r}
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
library(caret)
data(AlzheimerDisease)
```
Which of the following commands will create training and test sets with about 50% of the observations assigned to each?

```{r}
adData = data.frame(diagnosis,predictors)
trainIndex = createDataPartition(diagnosis, p = 0.50,list=FALSE)
training = adData[trainIndex,]
testing = adData[-trainIndex,]
length(diagnosis); dim(training); dim(testing)
```
