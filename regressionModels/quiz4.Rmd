## question 1

Consider the space shuttle data ?shuttle in the MASS library. Consider modeling the use of the autolander as the outcome (variable name use). Fit a logistic regression model with autolander (variable auto) use (labeled as "auto" 1) versus not (0) as predicted by wind sign (variable wind). Give the estimated odds ratio for autolander use comparing head winds, labeled as "head" in the variable headwind (numerator) to tail winds (denominator).

If I understand the question correctly we need to change the shuttle data so that the level value auto has a numeric value of 1 and noauto has a numeric value of 0

going through earlier lecture notes. I think all we need to do is use relevel(). If my notes are correct lm() will create the dummy variables for us and set the intercept to 'no auto'

### explore shuttle data

```{r}
library(MASS)
data(shuttle)

str(shuttle$use)
levels(shuttle$use)
unique(as.numeric(shuttle$use))

tt <-shuttle$use
#yy <- relevel(tt , ref="noauto")
tt[1:5]
as.numeric(tt[1:5])
#yy[1:5]
#as.numeric(yy[1:5])

```

### solution to question 1
```{r}
# we do not need to relevel
#shuttle$use <- relevel(shuttle$use , ref="noauto")
lr <- glm(use ~ wind, family="binomial", data=shuttle)

#log odds
round(lr$coefficients,3)

#odds
round(exp(lr$coefficients),3)

#Give the estimated odds ratio for autolander use comparing head winds, labeled as "head" in the variable headwind (numerator) to tail winds (denominator) ?

#went with answer for slope (ie windtail) == 0.9687
#i.e. we want odds not log odds, how ever I think we need to relevel $use
# if we relevel the answer is not in the list of solutions
round(exp(lr$coefficients[2]),3)
```


## question 2

Consider the previous problem. Give the estimated odds ratio for autolander use comparing head winds (numerator) to tail winds (denominator) adjusting for wind strength from the variable magn.

```{r}
lr <- glm(use ~ wind + magn, family="binomial", data=shuttle)

#log odds
lr$coefficients

#odds
round(exp(lr$coefficients),3)

# I do not get the exact anwer> choose 0.969
```

## question 3
If you fit a logistic regression model to a binary variable, for example use of the autolander, then fit a logistic regression model for one minus the outcome (not using the autolander) what happens to the coefficients?

The outcome is binary, 0 or 1. One minus the outcome will reverse the 0's and 1: 1-0 = 1 and 1-1=0.

a) The coefficients get inverted (one over their previous value).

b) The coefficients reverse their signs.

c) The coefficients change in a non-linear fashion.

d) The intercept changes sign, but the other coefficients don't.


I think the best answer is b. we have an "s curve", the transition from has a
positive slope and intercept is zero. When we flip, the transition has a neg slope
and intercept is 1.

```r
#d <- data.frame(y=c(rep(0,5),rep(1,5)), x=c(rnorm(5, mean=3, sd=0.1), rnorm(5, mean=6, sd=0.1)))
#lr <- glm(d$y ~ d$x, family="binomial")
#lr$coeffients

lr <- glm(use ~ wind, family="binomial", data=shuttle)
lr$coeffients

shuttle$use <- relevel(shuttle$use , ref="noauto")
lr <- glm(use ~ wind, family="binomial", data=shuttle)
lr$coeffients
```
