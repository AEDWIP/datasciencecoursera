##Question 1
Consider the mtcars data set. Fit a model with mpg as the outcome that includes number of cylinders as a factor variable and weight as confounder. Give the adjusted estimate for the expected change in mpg comparing 8 cylinders to 4.

Using str it turns out cyl, gear, am, and carb are numeric, not factors. We'll
need to convert them
```{r}
str(mtcars)
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
```

cyl levels are 4, 6, and 8. by default R will set the refference varriable 
(ie intercept) to the lowest level. intercept will be 4 cylinders
```{r}
summary(lm(mpg ~ cyl + wt, data=mtcars))$coefficients
c <- summary(lm(mpg ~ cyl, data=mtcars))$coefficients
cyl4 <- c[1]
cyl6 <- c[2]
cyl8 <- c[3]
#cyl4 - cyl8
```
answer is cyl8 == -6.0
