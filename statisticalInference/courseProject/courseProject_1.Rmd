### 1) Investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem.

"The expotential distrubtion is the probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process, i.e. a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.""

reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution

Clearly expotentially distributed random variables are not "bell shaped."

```{r}
lambda <- 0.2
numObservations <- 1000
hist(rexp(numObservations,lambda))
```


From the Central Limit Theorm we know that as the mean of a sample of expoentially distributed random variable should be normally distributed with the estimated becomming a better approximation of the true population mean as the sample size increase. We will use the following simulation to see if that is true

**Graph of 1000 random variables selected from a uniform distribution**

```{r}
hist(runif(1000))
```

**Graph the mean of 1000 samples**

each sample is comprised of 40 uniformaly distributed iid random. The means apear to be normally distributed

```{r}
mns = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mns = c(mns, mean(runif(40)))
hist(mns)
```

## the stuff bellow was by default when the document was created
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
