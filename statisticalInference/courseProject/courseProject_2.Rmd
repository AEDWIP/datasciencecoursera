1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses 

In RStudio run help(ToothGrowth) to see a description of the data set.

Description

The response is the length of odontoblasts (teeth) in each of 10 guinea pigs at each of three dose levels of Vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg) with each of two delivery methods (orange juice or ascorbic acid).

```{r}
str(ToothGrowth)

head(ToothGrowth)

nrow(ToothGrowth)
nrow(na.omit(ToothGrowth) )


```

---

2. Provide a basic summary of the data.

```{r}
summary(ToothGrowth)

```
---

3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)

First create 6 list, one for each combination of treament and dose
```{r}
vc05 <- ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp == "VC" & ToothGrowth$dose == 0.5]
vc1 <- ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp == "VC" & ToothGrowth$dose == 1.0]
vc2 <- ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp == "VC" & ToothGrowth$dose == 2.0]

oj05 <- ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ" & ToothGrowth$dose == 0.5]
oj1 <- ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ" & ToothGrowth$dose == 1.0]
oj2 <- ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ" & ToothGrowth$dose == 2.0]

```

There are six data groupings, OJ or VC by does. Calculate the mean of each group
```{r}
attach(ToothGrowth)
ag <- aggregate(ToothGrowth, by=list(supp,dose), FUN=mean)
ag
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
